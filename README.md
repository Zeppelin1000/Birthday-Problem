Draws Experimental and Theoretical Graphs on the Birthday Problem

When realising that three of my extended faimily's birthdays fell within 4 days of each other, it reminded me of a famous probability problem. I decided to knock out a quick program in Python to plot both the experimental and theoretical probabilities for this on the same graphs and share it with them.  

The Problem

How many perople need to be standing in the same room in order for it to be more likely that 2 people will share a birthday ?

Most people think this is more than it actually is and the actual number for this to be true is ONLY 23.  If 23 people are standing in a room then the probability that at least 2 will share the same birthday is in fact .507. i.e  greater than a half and odds-on.

Run the Birthday.ipynb file in this respoistory to see a graph of the experimental probability compared with the theoretical probability to see the results.

Having done a project on the FreeCodecamp involving experimental probability drawing coloured balls from a hat, I was interested to try and apply this in other sceanrios.  It is very quick to implement as you will see from the code in Birthday.ipynb.
